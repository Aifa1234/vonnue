        <h2>css styling</h2>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language 
            used to control the presentation and layout of HTML 
            documents. It allows developers to apply styles such
            as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to web 
            elements, making websites visually appealing and 
            user-friendly. CSS separates content from design, 
            enabling cleaner code and easier maintenance. It
            supports responsive design, allowing websites to
            adapt to different screen sizes across devices. 
            With features like selectors, classes, pseudo-classes,
            and media queries, CSS provides powerful tools for
            customizing the appearance of web pages efficiently 
            and consistently.

                <h1>basics of styling</h1>
                <p>basics of styling in CSS involve selecting HTML elements 
                   and applying visual rules to them. Styling begins with 
                   selectors (like element names, classes, or IDs) that
                   target specific parts of the HTML document. Once selected, 
                   properties such as `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`,
                   and `background` are used to define how the elements should appear.
                   Each style rule follows a simple syntax: `selector { property: value; }`.
                   CSS allows for inline, internal, and external stylesheets, with external
                   being the most commonly used for cleaner and reusable code. Understanding
                   the box model—which includes margins, borders, padding, and 
                   content—is fundamental to layout design. These basic styling 
                   concepts form the foundation for building responsive, attractive, 
                   and well-structured websites.
