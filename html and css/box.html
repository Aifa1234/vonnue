                A tree is a tall, perennial plant with
                a sturdy trunk, branches, and leaves.
                It plays a vital role in maintaining
                oxygen, absorbing carbon dioxide, 
                and providing shelter to various 
                species. Trees help prevent soil 
                erosion, purify the air, and offer
                shade and beauty to our surroundings. 
                From fruit-bearing trees to towering 
                evergreens, each type contributes uniquely 
                to the ecosystem. Beyond their environmental
                benefits, trees also hold cultural, spiritual,
                and economic importance in human life. 
                Protecting and planting trees is essential 
                for a healthier and more sustainable planet.

                        <p>A cloud is a visible mass of tiny water
                           droplets or ice crystals suspended in 
                           the atmosphere. Clouds form when moist 
                           air rises, cools, and condenses around 
                           dust or other particles in the air. They 
                           play a crucial role in Earth's weather 
                           and climate, influencing temperature, 
                           precipitation, and even the amount of 
                           sunlight that reaches the ground. There 
                           are many types of clouds, such as cumulus, 
                           stratus, and cirrus, each with unique 
                           shapes and characteristics. Beyond their 
                           scientific role, clouds often inspire art, 
                           imagination, and beauty in the natural world.
